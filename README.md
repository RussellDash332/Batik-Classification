# Batik-Classification

> **(2 Oct 2021) Happy Batik Day!**

A short introduction to Indonesian batik classification using CNN by [NgodingPython](https://www.youtube.com/c/NgodingPython/featured) during his livestream session.

According to [Yohanes Gultom](https://github.com/yohanesgultom/deep-learning-batik-classification), there are 5 classes in the dataset, namely:
1. Parang: parang (traditional blade) motifs
2. Lereng: also blade-like pattern but less pointy than Parang
3. Ceplok: repetition of geometrical motif shapes (eg. rectangle, square, ovals, stars)
4. Kawung: kawung fruits motif
5. Nitik: flowers-like motifs

This means the sixth class Mix motif, is just a mixture of these five.
